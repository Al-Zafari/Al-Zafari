# Hi there 👋

## 🚀 About Me
- 🔭 My research focuses on **dark matter phenomenological models** and their implications for **large-scale structure**, with an emphasis on developing frameworks to evaluate the **parameter space of viable candidates** under constraints from **direct detection, indirect detection, and collider experiments (LHC)**.  
- 🧠 I enjoy working at the intersection of **theory and astrophysical observation**, especially at the exciting edges of **quantum field theory, cosmology, gravity**, and their **observational consequences**.  

## 🎓 Academic Background
- 🎓 **Bachelor of Science in Physics** — *Shahid Beheshti University*  
- 🎓 **Master of Science in Particle Physics and Field Theory** — *Shahid Beheshti University*  

## 🎯 Hobbies and Interests
- 🧩 Passionate about **escape rooms and puzzle-solving**, as I enjoy challenges that spark creativity and excitement.  
- 🎮 Avid **video game enthusiast** — gaming is one of my favorite ways to recharge and stay sharp.
