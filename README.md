## Hi there 👋
## 🚀 About Me
- 🔭 My research focuses on **dark matter phenomenological models** and their impact on **large-scale structure**, with an emphasis on developing frameworks to evaluate the **parameter space of viable candidates** using constraints from **direct detection, indirect detection, and the LHC**.
- 🌌 Aiming to bridge **dark matter phenomenology** with **gravitational waves** as potential messengers from the **dark sector** of the universe.
- 🧠 I enjoy working at the intersection of **theory and astrophysical observation**, especially at the exciting edges of **quantum field theory**, **Cosmology**, **gravity**, and their **observational consequences**.

## 🎓 Academic Background
- 🎓 Bachelor of Science in Physics — **Shahid Beheshti University**.
- 🎓 Master of Science in Particle Physics and Field Theory — **Shahid Beheshti University**.
- 🎓 PhD Candidate in Science — **Sharif University of Technology**

## 🎯 Hobbies and Interests
- 🧩 Passionate about **escape rooms** and **puzzle-solving** — I love challenges that spark excitement!
- 🎮 Avid **video game enthusiast** — gaming is one of my favorite ways to recharge and stay sharp.
